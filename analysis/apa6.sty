\abstract{The financial flows in scholarly journal publishing have become increasingly complex with the growth of open access (OA), and the lack of data and transparency into these flows has been persistent. Opaqueness has concerned especially hybrid OA, where subscription-based journals also publish OA content if an optional fee is paid. By leveraging Elsevier’s recently introduced article metadata concerning invoiced recipients, this study provides the first longitudinal publisher-level study of uptake and invoicing of hybrid OA articles. The results show that the share of OA articles in Elseviers hybrid journals has grown slowly, from 2.6\% of all articles on average in 2015 to 3.7\% in 2019. About a third of hybrid OA articles are invoiced directly through an agreement with research funders or other type of organisational sponsor (e.g. national library consortia), with the majority invoiced to authors. 83\% of agreement-invoiced hybrid OA articles are to European organisations, suggesting a strong international skewness. The study discovered a large discrepancy in choice of publication license between author-invoiced articles (dominantly CC BY-NC-ND) and agreement-invoiced articles (dominantly CC BY). The results demonstrate the value of publisher-provided metadata covering invoiced recipients of articles, which would be even more useful through wider adoption among publishers.
