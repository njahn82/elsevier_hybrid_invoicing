Using text-mined data from web-archived Elsevier APC pricing lists  [@Matthias_2020], we were able to determine the evolution of Elsevier's open access journal portfolio. Figure shows that the majority of journals were hybrid journals. Overall, Elsevier published `r length(unique(els_jns$issn))` open access journals, of which `r els_jns %>%  filter(oa_model == "Hybrid") %>% distinct(issn) %>% nrow()` supported the hybrid model.

Elsevier's journal portfolio changed over the period of observation. The number of hybrid journals grew by  `r (els_jns_count %>% filter(oa_model == "Hybrid", year == 2020) %>% .$n) - (els_jns_count %>% filter(oa_model == "Hybrid", year == 2015) %>% .$n)` journals between 2015 and May 2020, while its proportion relative to Elsevier's overall journal portfolio slightly decreased from `r round(els_jns_count %>% filter(oa_model == "Hybrid", year == 2015) %>% .$prop, 2) * 100`% to `r round(els_jns_count %>% filter(oa_model == "Hybrid", year == 2020) %>% .$prop, 2) * 100`%. The year 2016 marked the highest number of journals. After that, the trend reversed. Since 2018, the number of journals stagnated. On 23 May 2020, Elsevier APC pricing list comprised `r length(unique(els_jns_df$issn))` journals, of which `r els_jns_df %>% filter(oa_type == "Hybrid") %>% distinct(issn) %>% nrow()` supported the hybrid model, representing a share of `r round(els_jns_df %>% filter(oa_type == "Hybrid") %>% distinct(issn) %>% nrow() / length(unique(els_jns_df$issn)) * 100, 0)`%.

#### How many of hybrid journals flipped to fully open access? 

```{r}
flipped_jns <- els_jns %>%
  distinct(issn, oa_model) %>%
  group_by(issn) %>%
  filter(n() > 1)
flipped_jns_ind <- els_jns %>%
  filter(issn %in% flipped_jns$issn) %>%
  group_by(issn) %>%
  slice(which.max(year)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  count(oa_model)
```

Following the approach of our earlier study [@Matthias_2019], we started with APC pricing list information to determine the number of open access business model flips between 2015-2020. Although the transition from hybrid to a fully open access business model has drawn most attention, also the reverse can be observed. A total number of `r sum(flipped_jns_ind$n)` journals changed the business model under the ownership of Elsevier. Of these, `r filter(flipped_jns_ind, oa_model == "Open Access")$n` journals flipped to fully open access, while `r filter(flipped_jns_ind, oa_model != "Open Access")$n` changed to hybrid open access. Examples for such reverse flipped open access journals include the physical journal *Materials Today* and the life science journal *Meta Gene*.

To determine the number of Elsevier hybrid journals with at least one open access article, we focused on the most current version of Elsevier's APC pricing list, lastly updated on 23 May 2020 [@Matthias_2020]. We used the Crossref index to determine the overall article volume of Elsevier's hybrid journal portfolio, and related it to the number of open access articles indicated by Creative Commons licenses. We only considered open access articles that were provided without delay, which we determined from mined full-text metadata. Because Elsevier also issued DOIs to non-scholarly journal content including table of contents and list of reviewers, we excluded these records using Unpaywall's paratext recognition approach [^1]. They account for about 2.5% of DOIs registered by Crossref.

On 23 May 2020, Elsevier APC pricing list comprised `r els_jns_df %>% filter(oa_type == "Hybrid") %>% distinct(issn) %>% nrow()` journals that supported the hybrid model. Of those, `r hybrid_df %>% filter(oa_archive == FALSE) %>% distinct(issn) %>% nrow()` hybrid journals published at least one open access article under a Creative Commons license between 2015 and 2019, corresponding to about `r round(hybrid_df %>% filter(oa_archive == FALSE) %>% distinct(issn) %>% nrow() / els_jns_df %>% filter(oa_type == "Hybrid") %>% nrow() * 100, 0)`% of journal titles in Elsevierâ€™s hybrid journal portfolio. At the same time, `r 100 - round(hybrid_df %>% filter(oa_archive == FALSE) %>% distinct(issn) %>% nrow() / els_jns_df %>% filter(oa_type == "Hybrid") %>% nrow() * 100, 0)`% of hybrid journals did not published an open access article.

Overall, `r total_df$journals` hybrid journals provided immediate open access to `r total_df$oa_n` articles between 2015 and 2019. The total share of hybrid open access in the Articles published of Elsevier journals was `r total_df$oa_uptake * 100`%. Table present the high-level findings by year, illustrating a moderate growth in hybrid open access. Although the number of hybrid journals with at least one open access article remained somehow constant, the number of open access articles rose substantially from `r ind_df %>% filter(issued_year == "2015") %>% pull(oa_n)` (2015) to `r ind_df %>% filter(issued_year == "2019") %>% pull(oa_n)` (2019). However, the overall uptake of open access in Elsevier's hybrid journal portfolio grew slowly from `r ind_df %>% filter(issued_year == 2015) %>% pull(oa_uptake)`% (2015) to `r ind_df %>% filter(issued_year == 2019) %>% pull(oa_uptake)`% (2019), because the number of articles published also increased during this five-years period.

Figure presents to which extent open access uptake rates varied among Elsevier hybrid journals between 2015 and 2019. The box-and-whiskers plot displays the distribution of the open access percentage per journal broken down by year. It visualizes the median open access proportion in the journal sample, the range of the majority of journals, and individual outliers represented as dots. Notably, upper quartiles and whiskers stretch farther over the years, indicating that the range of uptake among journals with an above-average proportion of open access articles increased over the years. Nevertheless, the prevalence of open access even among these journals can be described as relatively low; in 2019, 95% of Elsevier hybrid journals published `r perc_df %>% filter(issued_year == 2019) %>% pull(p_95) * 100`% or less open access articles.

Figure presents a breakdown by Creative Commons license variant used for hybrid open access by year. Elsevier provided commercial (cc-by) and a less permissive non-commercial license (cc-by-nc) for open access publishing in otherwise subscription-based journals. Nearly two-third of open access articles (`r  round(hybrid_license %>% group_by(cc_norm) %>% summarise(n = sum(cc_articles)) %>% mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) %>% filter(cc_norm == "cc-by-nc") %>% pull(prop) * 100,0)`%) can be re-used for non-commercial purposes.

Next, we present a breakdown of open content licensed articles by open access type relative to Elsevier's journal productivity (Figure). In total, Elsevier provided open access to `r sum(summary_licenses$n)` articles at he time of our study, corresponding to an open access share of `r round(sum(summary_licenses$n) / license_df %>% distinct(all_articles) %>% pull(all_articles) %>% sum() * 100, 0)`%. Hybrid open access had the lowest proportion (`r round(filter(summary_licenses, type == "hybrid_immediate_articles") %>% pull(prop) * 100)`), while over half of open access articles were made freely available after an embargo period (`r round(filter(summary_licenses, type == "hybrid_delayed_articles") %>% pull(prop) * 100, 0)`%) (Figure A). `r round(filter(summary_licenses, type == "full_oa") %>% pull(prop) * 100)`% of open access articles appeared in full open access journals.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figure", "license_portfolio.png"))
```

Figure B presents a breakdown of open content licensed articles by open access type and year relative to the total publication volume published in Elsevier journals between 2015-19. In addition to Creative Commons licenses, Elsevier also published delayed open access under an Elsevier user license (els-user), which prohibits re-use for commercial purposes. The license is mainly used by journals participating in Elsevier's open archive program comprising around 140 journals that make provide free access to published articles after an embargo period ranging between 12 months and 48 months. Figure reveals that about half of open access articles were made available under the Elsevier user license. The minority of open access articles can be re-used for commercial purposes (`r round(license_df %>% group_by(license_code) %>% summarise(n = sum(articles)) %>% mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) %>% filter(license_code == "cc-by") %>% pull(prop) * 100, 0)`% of open access articles under an CC-BY license). Hybrid open access had the highest proportion of openly available articles under a CC-BY licenses. 


### How many payments for open access articles in hybrid journals were invoiced to authors, to funders, and how many APCs were waived?

```{r}
# load eligible oa articles
hybrid_volume <- readr::read_csv(here::here("data", "hybrid_volume_eligible.csv"))

# aggregate data
sponsored_articles <- hybrid_volume %>%
  mutate(oa_sponsor_type = ifelse(is.na(oa_sponsor_type), "unknown", oa_sponsor_type)) %>%
  mutate(oa_sponsor_type = recode(oa_sponsor_type, 
                                  `FundingBody` = "Agreement",
                                  `ElsevierWaived` = "Fee Waived")) %>%
  mutate(fct_source = fct_infreq(oa_sponsor_type)) %>%
  mutate(fct_source = fct_lump(fct_source, prop = 0.05)) %>%
  count(issued_year, fct_source)
all_articles <- hybrid_volume %>%
  group_by(issued_year) %>%
  summarise(n = n())
```

In most cases, Elsevier sent invoices for hybrid open access publication fees to individual authors (`r round(hybrid_volume %>% filter(oa_sponsor_type == "Author") %>% nrow() / nrow(hybrid_volume) * 100, 0)`%). For around `r round(hybrid_volume %>% filter(oa_sponsor_type == "FundingBody") %>% nrow() / nrow(hybrid_volume) * 100, 0)`% of articles, the publisher directly billed funders and research organisations. The proportion of open access articles where Elsevier granted publication fee waivers was `r round(hybrid_volume %>% filter(oa_sponsor_type == "ElsevierWaived") %>% nrow() / nrow(hybrid_volume) * 100, 0)`%.

Figure \@ref(fig:invoiceoverview) shows the annual development per invoicing type. Each type is visualised separately as parts of the total. The grey areas show the overall yearly distribution of open access articles in hybrid journals, and the proportion of each invoicing type is highlighted in blue, The figure reveals a general growth of open access articles in hybrid journals. It illustrates that this development was mainly driven by billing individual authors, while central invoicing stagnated. Also, the amount of fee-waived articles remained more or less constant from 2015 to date.

```{r invoiceoverview, fig.cap="Development of fee-based open access publishing in Elsevier hybrid journals by invoicing type.

In terms of re-use, the type of invoicing is strongly related to whether the open content license permits commercial adaption or not (see figure). Although most open access articles published in Elsevier's hybrid journals were billed to authors directly, centrally invoiced articles accounted for the largest share of articles under an CC BY licenses (`r round(filter(license_count, fct_source == "Agreement", cc_norm == "cc-by") %>% pull(prop) * 100, 0)`%). Consequently, `r round(filter(license_summary_count, fct_source == "Agreement", cc_norm == "cc-by") %>% pull(prop) * 100, 0)`% of centrally invoiced articles permits commercial adaption.

```{r}
ggplot(cc_invoice, aes(factor(issued_year), n, fill = fct_source, group = fct_source)) +
  geom_area(stat = "identity",
            color = "white",
            alpha = 0.8,
            position = position_stack(reverse = T)) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05)),
    labels = function(x)
        format(x, big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE),
      breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()
  ) +
  facet_grid(~cc_norm) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  labs(x = "Publication year", y = "Total OA articles") +
  theme_minimal_hgrid() +
  theme(legend.position = "top",
        legend.justification = "right") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend("Invoicing"))
```



```{r}
# invoicing analysis
library(googlesheets4)
tt <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AqjCLn6VNGJpQ6zdmFSwuhFsDBIITSxijA0r0WLJZTQ/", sheet = 2)
```

```{r}
hybrid_invoice <- hybrid_volume %>%
  filter(oa_sponsor_type == "FundingBody") %>%
  rename(yrl_volume = articles) %>%
  left_join(tt, by = c("oa_sponsor_name"))

sponsor_country <- hybrid_invoice %>%
  mutate(Country = ifelse(is.na(Country), "Other", Country)) %>%
  mutate(country_factor = fct_lump(Country, prop = 0.025)) %>%
  group_by(country_factor) %>%
  summarise(n = n_distinct(doi)) %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))
```

Next, we examined funders and research organisations that were invoiced directly by Elsevier. In total, we were able to identify `r length(unique(hybrid_invoice$oa_sponsor_name))` sponsoring bodies. Figure presents a breakdown by country, highlighting the dominating role of a few countries. Not surprisingly, mostly British funders paid for hybrid open access in Elsevier hybrid journals (`r round(sponsor_country %>% filter(country_factor == "United Kingdom") %>% pull(prop) * 100, 0)`%), followed by funding bodies from the European Commission (`r round(sponsor_country %>% filter(country_factor == "Multinational") %>% pull(prop) * 100, 0)`%) and the Netherlands (`r round(sponsor_country %>% filter(country_factor == "The Netherlands") %>% pull(prop) * 100, 0)`%). In the latter case, invoices for individual open access articles were not send to research funders, but to the Dutch VSNU, a consortium  of Universities in the Netherlands that has negotiated agreements with Elsevier since 2016. The prominent role of Norway can be also explained by a national deal, which started in 2019. US-based open access sponsors originated mainly from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (n = `r hybrid_invoice %>% filter(oa_sponsor_name == "Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation") %>% distinct(doi) %>% nrow()`).

  mutate(country_factor = fct_reorder(country_factor, n)) %>%
